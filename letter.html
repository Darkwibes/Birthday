    <p class="main_letter">
        <div class="add">To Dear Cley, </div>
        <div class="main_letter">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A lot of words to say but I don't where to begin with, So I'll just start
        by saying "Happy Birthday Cley", My Babe, My Love, I Love You soo much. May God bless you and all 
        your wishes come true and all you problems disapper and never come back. Well this one will be a bit longer than the
        usual one's so just bare with me okay.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="main_letter">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I really hate not being able to be with you on such a day... I really miss you. Although I won't be
        able to see you wear a beautiful dress but without a hint of a doubt I know you'll look really really 
        beautiful today. Alright now, Let's stop being sad today, Afterall your Birthday is just getting started 
        I hope you have a great day and have a good time with your family and friends, Always keep smiling and be
         the cheerful, pretty and cute Babe you are.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="main_letter">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I wish i could've gotten you a gift 
            something way better this but this'll have to do for now and you already have a welkin so that's that 
             and I don't know if you already have a battle pass or not... Ahh well no point thinking about it now I guess.
            ( Note: To our future kids welkin is something that your mommy used to buy it was for a game so don't be confused 
            and if you found this letter never mention it NEVER!!! )
            Talking about Genshin impact it is what started it all right...</div>
        <br>
        <div class="main_letter">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thinking back now i realized we have known each
            other for more than 5 months now, I may not remember the date we met but I am grateful we did. Who would've thought
            getting bored and going into random people's world could be the begining of something this beautiful. I am thankful 
            to mihoyo for that, but I still hate them... If Genshin impact has cross our paths then discord is what truely 
            brought us closer, Talking to day after day never realized for a sec that I was falling for you and I am glad that 
            I did. I still remember how shy and awkward I was when we started dating, I used to get embarrassed at every small
            stuff and whatever you say used to make my heart beat soo fast. Yeah it all went away the day you suddenly called 
            me horny... ( Note: nothing weird here NOTHING!!! ), Yep the day you left me speechless for the first time. Well 
            time went by and stuff like this has only brought us closer.

        <div class="main_letter">

            by my side. I am sorry that I am working on this without telling you, Ahh I hope my plan to suprise you doesn't back fire
            this time atleast or I'll be really scared of surprising you ever again... Hahaha please just don't be mad. Haah I suddenly
            want to flirt with you, Ahh it's almost 3:00 AM ( Note: Staying up late is bad for your health never do that but if it's for your lovely girlfriend then just F**k it!!! 
            ( Note: Never use bad word NEVER!!! ))and I am thinking about flirting :xiao_fallen: Haah thinking about you really does makes me crazy. Well what can I do you are just
             so adorable all the time I wanna squeeze your cheeks now( Note: By cheeks I mean cheeks and nothing else ) Ahem!!!... What a useless note.

            so much, and like I said a lot of reasons First for loving me back, Giving me gifts, Accepting our differences, Loving me for who I am 
            , Being there for me when I need you, Not leaving me alone even when I tell you to, Cheering me up, Telling me to
            do my best, Asking me how my day went, Trying to make conversations, Caring about me, Your Good Night, Your Good mornings and
             all that small stuff you don't even know it all counts every last one of em. I trurly appriciate you and what you do for me, 
            For everyone it may seem a natural stuff to do but I can see the effort you take in doing them.
